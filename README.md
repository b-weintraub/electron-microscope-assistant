## Summary

## Background

Electron microscopes (EMs) such as transmission electron microscopes (TEMs) and scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) are useful for probing matter at magnifications beyond what’s possible using light microscopes, whose resolution is limited by the abbe diffraction limit. EMs can achieve sub-nanometer resolutions and are useful for characterizing nano-materials, or materials with dimensions on the order of billionths of a meter.  However, EMs are complex instruments requiring ultra-high vacuum systems and are thus expensive to operate.  It would be useful to develop methods to reduce the length of time required to analyze samples and increase sample analysis throughput.  Electron microscopists spend much of their time searching for target samples on the substrate as this process can be likened to “finding a needle in a haystack”.

This project looks for ways to automate parts of the electron microscopy process by using neural networks to identify nano-materials from scanning electron microscope images.


## Dataset

The dataset contains 21,283 scanning electron microscope (SEM) images produced at Institute of Materials, CNR (https://b2share.eudat.eu/records/80df8606fcdb4b2bae1656f0dc6db8ba).  The images were broken up into 10 categories as shown in the below table.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

| category     | Number of images |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Biological | 973    |
| Fibres | 163    |   
| Films_Coated_Surface      |327     |
| MEMS_devices_and_electrodes  | 4591     |
| Nanowires  | 3821     |
| Particles  | 3926     |
| Patterned_surface  | 4756     |
| Porous_Sponge  | 182     |
| Powder  | 918     |
| Tips  | 1625     |


Here are some representative images of each of the 10 categories.

Although the images are grayscale, they are encoded in 3 RGB channels. Each image contains a color metadata tag including magnification, stage tilt angle, working distance, etc.  The tag was not removed. 

# Data preprocessing

The data was split into 70% training, 20% validation and 10% holdout and uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket for later processing on an EC2 instance.

Training image data were augmented by transformations including rotation, width/height shift, shearing and zoom.



## Models

## Training
To handle the heavy processing, all computing was performed on an AWS EC2 instance (32 vCPU, 128 GiB memory). The model was training for 20 epochs.  Tensorboard was used to monitor the progress of the models.
